# My-Site
My Web Page

This will be my personal web site to showcase my skills as a software engineer. It will be built using traditional HTML5, and vanilla CSS so i can gain a deeper understanding of them for the future. I will use front-end JS and try to implement some fun ideas to make the website fun and interactice. i'll take inspiration from others amazing sites i find.

Notes for Me

1. In the future, include pricing structure for private work.
2. Ensure page is viewable on all browsers and test on different screen sizes and mobile.
3. Add in a drop down menu to my nav bar.
4. Use Stable Diffusion to create a great Phatasy image of myself, simple, clean and hi-res.
5. Create and add a logo to things. look for advice on designing a logo. Use MC for Moore codes and find a way to link them together. look for other great logos.
6. Make sure i make my site accesible to all and look into making things accesible for disabled users.
