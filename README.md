# My-Site
My Web Page

This will be my personal web site to showcase my skills as a software engineer. It will be built using traditional HTML5, and vanilla CSS & JS so i can gain a deeper understanding of them for the future. I will use front-end JS and try to implement some fun ideas to make the website fun and interactive. i'll take inspiration from others amazing sites i find.

Notes for Me

1. In the future, include pricing structure for private work.
2. Ensure page is viewable on all browsers and test on different screen sizes and mobile.
3. Add in a drop down menu to my nav bar.
4. Use Stable Diffusion to create a great Phatasy image of myself, simple, clean and hi-res.
6. Make sure i make my site accesible to all and look into making things accesible for disabled users.
7. Test my site on all browsers and screen sizes - is it fully responsive? Firefox, Edge, Chrome, Safari - any others?
8. Make a responsive Logo, which says MC, but when you hover over it, it stretches out to say Moore Codes.
9. Make sure my font-selections are safe. Will i need custom fonts, recall the video from the CSS guy on shrinking Google fonts size down to increase speed.
11. split my deveopment into smaller chunks, just like with a big project.
 a. borrow a HD camera and take some nice pics of myself for branding.
 b. get the email me section working.
 c. footer bar with copywright and anything else?
 d. get a domain name. how much?
 g. Tidy up my navbar - perfect it.
 h. split my sections across a long scroll down page, with blocks of colour to seperate? apply my font stylings too.
 i. include some nice images of myself
 j. consider borrowing heavily from Payton Clark Smith Youtube channel Perfect Homepage Design Explained (in 15 minutes).
 k. I've had a great idea for a funny yet relevant landing page graphic. title top left, image block right of a laptop screen, slightly cartoonish, on it, i'll have lines of code saying basic if statements with why people should hire me if ( looking for excellent dev ) { send email and invite for interview;} for ( company looking for talent: if position empty: email Ian ). would look good, be pertinant and i could try to get it to move and do stuff. maybe get each letter typed out on a blank screen would be fun. 
 l. design my skills table section - what to feature, look at my cv 
 m. Add in my kata and coding game links, once i've boosted them a bit.
 m. apply 60 30 10 colour rule, 60 background light colour, 30% brighter colour, 10% call to action colour.

 Use the 5 things to improve principle to continue working on my site. What are 5 things, i don't like, that i can change to make it better. 1 add fonts 2. add space between my text and create a better layout - left and right. 3. Get some nice images to appear alongside my text 4. add in my table with my skills 5. make a nice AI generated image of me.
